### Depth-first Search Solution
Recursively evaluate the `piles` array from both the start and end,
using a flag variable `isAliceTurn` to track whose turn it is and only calculate the sum for Alice.  
Since the game ends when one player takes more than half of the total stones,
the recursion can terminate early, ensuring only one player wins.
```java
class Solution {
  public boolean stoneGame(int[] piles) {
    int sum = Arrays.stream(piles).sum();
    return dfs(piles, (double)sum/2, 0, piles.length-1,0,true);
  }

  /**
   * Recursive DFS function to determine if Alice can win.
   * 
   * @param piles           The array of stone piles.
   * @param hsum            Half of the total sum of stones (the target for Alice to win).
   * @param left            The current left index of the pile range.    
   * @param right           The current right index of the pile range.
   * @param aliceSum        The current sum of stones collected by Alice.
   * @param isAliceTurn     A boolean indicating whether it is Alice's turn.
   * @return                True if Alice can win, otherwise false.
   */
  private boolean dfs(int[] piles, double hsum, int left, int right, int aliceSum, boolean isAliceTurn){
    // If Alice's current sum exceeds half of the total sum, she wins.
    if(aliceSum>hsum)return true;
    if(left >= right)return false;
    if(piles[left]>piles[right]){
      return dfs(piles, hsum, left+1, right, aliceSum+piles[left], !isAliceTurn);
    }else if(piles[left]<piles[right]){
      return dfs(piles, hsum, left, right-1, aliceSum+piles[right], !isAliceTurn);
    }else{
      return dfs(piles, hsum, left+1, right, aliceSum+piles[left], !isAliceTurn) || dfs(piles, hsum, left, right-1, aliceSum+piles[right], !isAliceTurn);
    }
  }
}
```
#### Complexity Analysis
* Time Complexity: $O(2^n)$

    The recursion only branches when `piles[left] == piles[right]`; otherwise it follows a single path.  
    In the worst case, many piles are equal, so each step has two choices and the recursion tree has size $O(2^n)$, where $n$ is `right-left`.
    Therefore, the overall time complexity is $O(2^n)$.
    
* Space Complexity: $O(n)$ 

    The depth of the recursive call stack is `right-left`, representing the number of choices for Alice and Bob,
    resulting in a total space complexity of $O(n)$.



### Dynamic Programming Solution
#### Initialization  
Define a two-dimensional array `dp`, where both the rows and columns correspond to the indices of the array `piles`.  
The `dp[i][j]` represents the difference between the number of stones Alice has and the number of stones Bob has, when considering the subarray from index `i` to `j` of the piles array.  
When `i` equals `j`, there is only a single pile of stones, which is `piles[i]`.
Since Alice goes first, she takes this pile, so `dp[i][j]=piles[i]`.
####  Filling the DP Table  
The dynamic programming equation can be expressed as follows:
```text
dp[i][j] = 
    piles[i] - dp[i+1][j],         If the current player picks the pile at index i.
    piles[j] - dp[i][j - 1],       If the current player picks the pile at index j.
```
The negative sign in `"- dp[i+1][j]"` and `"- dp[i][j - 1]"`  is used to reverse the difference in the number of stones between the players when the turn changes.  
Since both players play optimally, the current player will choose the pile with the most stones.  
The equation will be:
```text
dp[i][j] = Math.max(piles[i] - dp[i+1][j], piles[j] - dp[i][j - 1])
```
Fill the DP table in a bottom-up matter.
The current problem (i, j) depends on the results of (i + 1, j) and (i, j - 1).   
By filling the table from the smallest subproblems to larger subproblems (from the end towards the start for i), 
we ensure that `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]` are already computed when needed.  
Here is a random example:
```text
piles = 1 4 5 2 3 8 7 9 2 3
sum = 44
```

```text
indices:  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
piles:    1 4 5 2 3 8 7 9 2 3

Step 1:
dp[0][0] = 1 
dp[1][1] = 4
...
dp[9][9] = 3


Step 2: 
dp[8][9] = Math.max( 2 - dp[9][9], 3 - dp[8][8] )

Step 3:
dp[7][8] = Math.max( 9 - dp[8][8], 2 - dp[7][7] ) 
dp[7][9] = Math.max( 9 - dp[8][9], 3 - dp[7][8] )

Step 4:
dp[6][7] = Math.max( 7 - dp[7][7], 9 - dp[6][6] ) 
dp[6][8] = Math.max( 7 - dp[7][8], 2 - dp[6][7] ) 
dp[6][9] = Math.max( 7 - dp[7][9], 3 - dp[6][8] ) 
...
```
####  Result  
The result is determined based on whether the score difference for the entire array (`dp[0][length - 1]`) is positive, indicating that the first player Alice can secure a win.

Here is the solution:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean stoneGame(int[] piles) {
        int length = piles.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[length][length];
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            dp[i][i] = piles[i];
        }
        // Fill the DP table in a bottom-up matter. 
        for (int i = length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < length; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(piles[i] - dp[i + 1][j], piles[j] - dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
        return dp[0][length - 1] > 0;
    }
}
```
#### Complexity Analysis
* Time Complexity: $O(n^2)$ 

    The sum of iterations for both loop is:  
    $$1+2+3+...+(n-1) = \frac{(n-1) \times n}{2} =  O(n^2)$$
* Space Complexity: $O(n^2)$ 

    The algorithm uses a two-dimensional array `dp` of size `n×n`, where `n` is the length of the input array `piles`.
    The space required for this array is $O(n^2)$ .
### Optimized Dynamic Programming Solution
The computation of each cell `dp[i][j]` only depends on values from the current row `i` and the next row `i + 1`,
Thus, We can reuse values in a single one-dimensional array.
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean stoneGame(int[] piles) {
        int length = piles.length;
        int[] dp = new int[length];
        System.arraycopy(piles, 0, dp, 0, length);
        for (int i = length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < length; j++) {
                dp[j] = Math.max(piles[i] - dp[j], piles[j] - dp[j - 1]);
            }
        }
        return dp[length - 1] > 0;
    }
}
```
#### Complexity Analysis
* Time Complexity: $O(n^2)$ 

    The sum of iterations for both loop is:  
    $$1+2+3+...+(n-1) = \frac{(n-1) \times n}{2} =  O(n^2)$$
* Space Complexity: $O(n)$  

    The size of one-dimensional array `dp` is `n`, corresponding to the length of the input array.
    The space requried for this array is $O(n)$.
